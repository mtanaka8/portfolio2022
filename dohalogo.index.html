                        <i>
                           We were tasked to create a logo for a city of our choice. The city I've chosen was Doha which is located
                           in Qatar. I became drawn to the city's attractions and its significant culture.
                        </i>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Doha is a beautiful city with many attractions which gave me a lot of ideas to start with.
                        I had to undergo the sketching process a few times but I have found three concepts to work with. 
                        Eventually, one of the three concepts has been chosen. I experimented with different colors and my final logo for Doha has been 
                        made.
