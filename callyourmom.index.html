                           We were tasked to create three book covers based on the podcasts we've chosen from a list.
                           I've chosen Phoebe Judge. Each podcasts found within the Phoebe Judge episodes deals with 
                           alot of mysteries and horrors which I tend to enjoy.

                        It took time to figure out what the book cover of each story should look like. 
                        There were mutiple sketches but many of them did not fit the storyline. Eventually, I found
                        the solution and I discovered the right "face" of the "Call Your Mom" podcast. The experience of the
                        this design process has taught me how to be able to execute specific deliverables.
